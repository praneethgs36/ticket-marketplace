# Ticket Mart
This is a website that offers a marketplace to buy and sell non-cancellable movie tickets bought online in India. In version 1.0, which will be an MVP, the ticket details verification will be done manually by having the tickets uploaded from verified user accounts. 

In version 2.0, I am planning to add a zero-knowledge cryptographic algorithm to encrypt ticket details and hence avoid duplication of tickets. It will be verified with the information from the online vendor via an API integration.

The website should have a minimum of 3 pages. 

1. The ‚ÄúHome‚Äù page, which lists the tickets available to buy. It should also have the option to enter the location of user. 

1. The ‚ÄúSell your tickets‚Äù page which allows users to sell their tickets at a discounted price. 
2. The ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù page to clear the queries of the users.
